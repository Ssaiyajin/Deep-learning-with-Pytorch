## Files

- **`deeplearning.ipynb`** – Main notebook containing:
  - Data loading
  - Model definitions
  - Training loops
  - Utility functions (`train`, `test`, `fwd_pass`)
- **Training data** (generated by the notebook):
  - `training_data_images.npy`
  - `training_data_labels.npy`
- **Models & examples:**
