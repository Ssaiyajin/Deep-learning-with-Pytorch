# 🧠 PyTorch Neural Network Experiments with Pytorch

**Author:** Nihar Sawant  
**Tools:** Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  

This project contains PyTorch notebooks and scripts for experimenting with **basic neural networks** and **convolutional models**, including:

- MNIST digit classification  
- Dogs vs Cats image classification  

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`deeplearning.ipynb`** – Main notebook containing:
  - Data loading
  - Model definitions
  - Training loops
  - Utility functions (`train`, `test`, `fwd_pass`)
- **Training Data** (generated by the notebook):
  - `training_data_images.npy`
  - `training_data_labels.npy`
- **Models & Examples:**
  - `Net` class – simple fully-connected MNIST classifier
  - `DogsVSCats` – convolutional model and dataset builder

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch & torchvision
- NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Matplotlib
- tqdm (for progress bars)

---

## 📦 Installation (Linux & Windows)
 **Upgrade pip**:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python tqdm
pip install torch torchvision

```

# ⚠️ Installation Notes

## Windows Users Warning

- Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.  
- Use a **virtual environment** to avoid dependency conflicts.  
- If you encounter errors installing `torch` or `opencv-python`, ensure your Python version is compatible and reinstall the packages.  
- On some systems, you may need to run your terminal as **Administrator**.

## Linux Recommendation

- Linux (e.g., Ubuntu) generally provides **smoother installation** and better compatibility with Python packages like PyTorch and OpenCV.
