# Deep-learning-with-PyTorch

**Author:** Nihar Sawant  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  

A collection of PyTorch notebooks and scripts for experimenting with basic neural networks and convolutional models (MNIST, Dogs vs Cats examples).

## Files
- [deeplearning.ipynb](Deep-learning-with-Pytorch/deeplearning.ipynb) — main notebook containing data loading, model definitions and training loops.
- Training data (generated by the notebook): `training_data_images.npy`, `training_data_labels.npy`.

## Highlights
- Simple fully-connected MNIST classifier implemented as the [`Net` class](Deep-learning-with-Pytorch/deeplearning.ipynb) in the notebook.
- Convolutional model and dataset builder for a Dogs vs Cats example (see [`DogsVSCats`](Deep-learning-with-Pytorch/deeplearning.ipynb)).
- Utility functions / flows: [`train`](Deep-learning-with-Pytorch/deeplearning.ipynb), [`test`](Deep-learning-with-Pytorch/deeplearning.ipynb) and [`fwd_pass`](Deep-learning-with-Pytorch/deeplearning.ipynb) are implemented in the notebook for training and evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch & torchvision
- NumPy, OpenCV (cv2), tqdm, matplotlib

## Quick install
```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install torch torchvision numpy opencv-python tqdm matplotlib

```
